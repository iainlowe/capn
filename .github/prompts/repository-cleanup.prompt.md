# Repository Cleanup and Maintenance

Perform a quick cleanup and maintenance of this Go repository:

## Quick Actions
1. **Lint Check**: Run `golangci-lint run` and fix any issues found
2. **Build Verification**: Run `go build ./...` to ensure compilation
3. **Test Verification**: Run `go test ./...` to ensure all tests pass

## Repository Cleanup
1. **Update .gitignore**: Add missing patterns for:
   - Coverage files: `*.out`, `*_coverage.out`, `coverage.html`
   - Build artifacts: `capn`, `dist/`, `build/`
   - Temporary files: `*.tmp`, `*.temp`
   - Demo executables: `agent_communication_demo`

2. **Clean Files**: Remove files matching .gitignore patterns:
   ```bash
   rm -f *.out *_coverage* coverage.html *.tmp *.temp
   rm -f capn agent_communication_demo
   rm -rf dist/ build/
   ```

## Quality Checks
- Ensure no compilation errors
- Verify all tests still pass
- Check for obvious code quality issues
- Confirm clean git status

## Commit Changes
Create a focused commit:
```
chore: clean up repository and update .gitignore

- Add comprehensive .gitignore patterns
- Remove build artifacts and coverage files  
- Fix any lint issues found
- Maintain test coverage
```

This is a lightweight maintenance task focused on repository hygiene and basic quality checks.
